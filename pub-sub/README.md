we're going to build a simple logging system. It will consist of two programs -- the first will emit log messages and the second will receive and print them.

In our logging system every running copy of the receiver program will get the messages. That way we'll be able to run one receiver and direct the logs to disk; and at the same time we'll be able to run another receiver and see the logs on the screen.

## Exchange
the producer can only send messages to an exchange. An exchange is a very simple thing. On one side it receives messages from producers and the other side it pushes them to queues. The exchange must know exactly what to do with a message it receives
There are a few exchange types available: direct, topic, headers and fanout

We want to hear about all log messages, not just a subset of them. We're also interested only in currently flowing messages not in the old ones. To solve that we need two things.

Firstly, whenever we connect to Rabbit we need a fresh, empty queue. To do this we could create a queue with a random name, or, even better - let the server choose a random queue name for us.

Secondly, once we disconnect the consumer the queue should be automatically deleted.

In the amqp client, when we supply queue name as an empty string, we create a non-durable queue with a generated name.

When the connection that declared it closes, the queue will be deleted because it is declared as exclusive

## Bindings
That relationship between exchange and a queue is called a binding.
